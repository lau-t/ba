 * @brief Class for loading and accessing skeleton marker and joint information from an ADT
 * sequence. Motive (the software running Optitrack) generates a frame of marker positions for each
 * capture corresponding to each bodysuit in the scene. It then estimates the person's joint
 * positions for each of these marker frames. ADT converts these measurements to the Scene frame to
 * be consistent with all ground truth data and this class allows the user to load and query that
 * data. We provide a separate class from the main AriaDigitalTwinDataProvider to separate out the
 * skeleton loading and allow users to call this API without loading all other ADT data.
