# Aria Digital Twin Dataset Tools

Welcome to Aria Digital Twin (ADT) Dataset Tools! ADT is an initiative within the broader [Project Aria](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/) umbrella with the goal of providing the most precise and comprehensively labeled Egocentric dataset in real world environments. The types of data annotations included in ADT include: 2d/3d object bounding boxes, eye gaze direction and depth, depth images, segmentation images, and a full synthetic twin recording for each raw dataset. We do this by fully digitizing each environment including all objects visible by Aria, and integrate Optitrack for precise tracking of dynamic objects.

Please see [our website](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/adt/) for general information on ADT and Project Aria.

Please see [our wiki](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset/) for quick start guide and detailed technical documentation on the ADT Dataset Tools.
